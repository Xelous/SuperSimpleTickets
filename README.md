# SuperSimpleTickets
Intended as a self-improvement project, this is a very basic software ticketing system, where one is able to provide very basic text based descriptions of faults, add notes to, assign for work, or sign off a ticket.

Intended to be light, fast it has been implemented to use the local instance of mysql, python, mysql-connnector and the Flask libraries.

# Python
It is also intended as a self-improvement project with my experience of restful API design, specifically through Flask.
